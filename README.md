Solving problem:

How do we empower Canadians with lower digital literacy levels or who are intimidated by technology to understand the importance of digital literacy for themselves or their children?

Description

Software is transforming the world we live in today, but many experienced professionals are struggling to adapt to the changing landscape. Our goal with this project is to help professionals who might be intimidated by coding and have no previous coding experience and guide them from not knowing any coding to using coding as a tool they can leverage to complete the work they already have and in a more efficient way.
